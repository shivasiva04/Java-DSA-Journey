## 💡 Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and implementation log for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. The goal is to master efficient coding practices, understand time complexity, and prepare for technical problem-solving using **Java**.

## 📚 Topics Roadmap
This project covers the implementation and application of the following core computer science concepts:

### 1. Linear Data Structures
* **Arrays & Strings:** Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Prefix Sum.
* **Linked Lists:** Singly, Doubly, Fast & Slow Pointers.
* **Stacks & Queues:** Monotonic Stack, Priority Queues.

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
* **Trees:** Binary Trees, BST, Traversals (BFS/DFS), Tries.
* **Heaps:** Min-Heap, Max-Heap, Heap Sort.
* **Graphs:** Adjacency Matrix/List, Dijkstra, Prim's, Topological Sort.

### 3. Core Algorithms
* **Searching:** Binary Search variations.
* **Sorting:** Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Cycle Sort.
* **Recursion & Backtracking:** Permutations, Subsets.
* **Dynamic Programming (DP):** 1D/2D DP, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence.

## ⚡ Performance Focus
All solutions are written with a focus on:
* **Time Complexity:** Minimizing Big-O (e.g., O(n) vs O(n²)).
* **Space Complexity:** Efficient memory management.
* **Clean Code:** Proper naming conventions and modular design.

### Why this is a good choice:
1.  **Shows Ambition:** Even if you have only done "Day 1", listing things like "Dynamic Programming" and "Graphs" shows recruiters you have a plan to learn the hard stuff.
2.  **Keywords:** It is packed with keywords (Sliding Window, Dijkstra, Big-O) that automated resume scanners and recruiters look for.
3.  **Educational Tone:** It looks like a professional reference guide.

**Would you like me to show you how to structure your folders by *Topic* (e.g., `src/com/siva/dsa/arrays`) instead of by *Day* (e.g., `day01`), since this README suggests a topic-based structure?**
