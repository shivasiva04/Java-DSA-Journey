## 💡 Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide and implementation log for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. The goal is to master efficient coding practices, understand time complexity, and prepare for technical problem-solving using **Java**.

## 📚 Topics Roadmap
This project covers the implementation and application of the following core computer science concepts:

### 1. Linear Data Structures
* **Arrays & Strings:** Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Prefix Sum.
* **Linked Lists:** Singly, Doubly, Fast & Slow Pointers.
* **Stacks & Queues:** Monotonic Stack, Priority Queues.

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structures
* **Trees:** Binary Trees, BST, Traversals (BFS/DFS), Tries.
* **Heaps:** Min-Heap, Max-Heap, Heap Sort.
* **Graphs:** Adjacency Matrix/List, Dijkstra, Prim's, Topological Sort.

### 3. Core Algorithms
* **Searching:** Binary Search variations.
* **Sorting:** Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Cycle Sort.
* **Recursion & Backtracking:** Permutations, Subsets.
* **Dynamic Programming (DP):** 1D/2D DP, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence.

## ⚡ Performance Focus
All solutions are written with a focus on:
* **Time Complexity:** Minimizing Big-O (e.g., O(n) vs O(n²)).
* **Space Complexity:** Efficient memory management.
* **Clean Code:** Proper naming conventions and modular design.
